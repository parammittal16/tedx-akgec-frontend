        <div class="about-content">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
          Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
           took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
           but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. I was popularised in the 1960s 
           with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
           desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>

        <div class="about-content white-text">TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years
        ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading
        thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers
        have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala,
        Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.</div>

          <div class="about-content white-text">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized 
            events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers 
            combine to spark deep discussion and connection.These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx,
             where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, 
             but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)
